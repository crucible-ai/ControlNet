# Overview:

This dataset is designed to train a ControlNet with human facial expressions.  It includes keypoints for pupils to allow gaze direction.  Training has been tested on Stable Diffusion v2.1 base (512) and Stable Diffusion v1.5.

## Samples:

Cherry-picked from ControlNet + Stable Diffusion v2.1 Base

## Dataset Contents:

- train_laion_face.py - Entrypoint for ControlNet training.
- laion_face_dataset.py - Code for performing dataset iteration.  Cropping and resizing happens here.
- tool_download_face_targets.py - A tool to read metadata.json and populate the target folder.
- tool_generate_face_poses.py - The original file used to generate the source images.  Included for reproducibility, but not required for training.
- training/laion-face-processed/prompt.jsonl - Read by laion_face_dataset.  Includes prompts for the images.
- training/laion-face-processed/metadata.json - Excerpts from LAION for the relevant data.  Also used for downloading the target dataset.
- training/laion-face-processed/source/xxxxxxxxx.jpg - Images with detections performed.  Generated from the target images.
- training/laion-face-processed/target/xxxxxxxxx.jpg - Selected images from LAION Face.

## Dataset Construction:

Source images were generated by pulling slice 00000 from LAION Face and passing them through MediaPipe's face detector with special configuration parameters.  

The colors and line thicknesses used for MediaPipe are as follows:

```
f_thick = 2
f_rad = 1
right_iris_draw = DrawingSpec(color=(10, 200, 250), thickness=f_thick, circle_radius=f_rad)
right_eye_draw = DrawingSpec(color=(10, 200, 180), thickness=f_thick, circle_radius=f_rad)
right_eyebrow_draw = DrawingSpec(color=(10, 220, 180), thickness=f_thick, circle_radius=f_rad)
left_iris_draw = DrawingSpec(color=(250, 200, 10), thickness=f_thick, circle_radius=f_rad)
left_eye_draw = DrawingSpec(color=(180, 200, 10), thickness=f_thick, circle_radius=f_rad)
left_eyebrow_draw = DrawingSpec(color=(180, 220, 10), thickness=f_thick, circle_radius=f_rad)
mouth_draw = DrawingSpec(color=(10, 180, 10), thickness=f_thick, circle_radius=f_rad)
head_draw = DrawingSpec(color=(10, 200, 10), thickness=f_thick, circle_radius=f_rad)

iris_landmark_spec = {468: right_iris_draw, 473: left_iris_draw}
```

We have implemented a method named `draw_pupils` which modifies some functionality from MediaPipe.  It exists as a stopgap until some pending changes are merged.


# Usage:

The containing ZIP file should be decompressed into the root of the ControlNet directory.  The `train_laion_face.py`, `laion_face_dataset.py`, and other `.py` files should sit adjacent to `tutorial_train.py` and `tutorial_train_sd21.py`.  We are assuming a checkout of the ControlNet repo at 0acb7e5, but there is no direct dependency on the repository.

## Downloading:

For copyright reasons, we cannot include the original target files.  We have provided a script (tool_download_face_targets.py) which will read from training/laion-face-processed/metadata.json and populate the target folder.  This file has no requirements, but will use tqdm if it is installed.

## Training:

When the targets folder is fully populated, training can be run on a machine with at least 24 gigabytes of VRAM.  Our model was trained for 200 hours (four epochs) on an A6000.

```bash
python tool_add_control.py ./models/v1-5-pruned-emaonly.ckpt ./models/controlnet_sd15_laion_face.ckpt
python ./train_laion_face_sd15.py
```

## Inference:

We have provided `gradio_face2image.py`.  Update the following two lines to point them to your trained model.

```
model = create_model('./models/cldm_v21.yaml').cpu()  # If you fine-tuned on SD2.1 base, this does not need to change.
model.load_state_dict(load_state_dict('./models/control_sd21_openpose.pth', location='cuda'))
```
